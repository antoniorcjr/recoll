        <span class="command"><strong>recoll</strong></span> GUI are set through the
        <span class="guilabel">Preferences</span> menu and stored in the standard Qt
        place (<code class="filename">$HOME/.config/Recoll.org/recoll.conf</code>).
        You probably do not want to edit this by hand.</p><p><span class="application">Recoll</span> indexing options are set inside text configuration
        files located in a configuration directory. There can be
        several such directories, each of which defines the parameters
        for one index.</p><p>The configuration files can be edited by hand or through
        the <span class="guilabel">Index configuration</span> dialog 
        (<span class="guilabel">Preferences</span> menu). The GUI tool will try
        to respect your formatting and comments as much as possible,
        so it is quite possible to use both ways.</p><p>The most accurate documentation for the
        configuration parameters is given by comments inside the default
        files, and we will just give a general overview here.</p><p>By default, for each index, there are two sets of
        configuration files. System-wide configuration files are kept
        in a directory named
        like <code class="filename">/usr/[local/]share/recoll/examples</code>,
        and define default values, shared by all indexes. For each
        index, a parallel set of files defines the customized
        parameters.</p><p>In addition (as of <span class="application">Recoll</span> version 1.19.7), it is possible
        to specify two additional configuration directories which will
        be stacked before and after the user configuration
        directory. These are defined by
        the <code class="envar">RECOLL_CONFTOP</code>
        and <code class="envar">RECOLL_CONFMID</code> environment
        variables. Values from configuration files inside the top
        directory will override user ones, values from configuration
        files inside the middle directory will override system ones
        and be overriden by user ones. These two variables may be of
        use to applications which augment <span class="application">Recoll</span> functionality, and
        need to add configuration data without disturbing the user's
        files. Please note that the two, currently single, values will
        probably be interpreted as colon-separated lists in the
        future: do not use colon characters inside the directory
        paths.</p><p>The default location of the configuration is the
        <code class="filename">.recoll</code>
        directory in your home. Most people will only use this
        directory.</p><p>This location can be changed, or others can be added with the
        <code class="envar">RECOLL_CONFDIR</code> environment variable or the
        <code class="option">-c</code> option parameter to <span class="command"><strong>recoll</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>recollindex</strong></span>.</p><p>If the <code class="filename">.recoll</code> directory does not
        exist when <span class="command"><strong>recoll</strong></span> or
        <span class="command"><strong>recollindex</strong></span> are started, it will be created
        with a set of empty configuration files.
        <span class="command"><strong>recoll</strong></span> will give you a chance to edit the
        configuration file before starting
        indexing. <span class="command"><strong>recollindex</strong></span> will proceed
        immediately. To avoid mistakes, the automatic directory
        creation will only occur for the
       default location, not if <code class="option">-c</code> or
       <code class="envar">RECOLL_CONFDIR</code> were used (in the latter
       cases, you will have to create the directory).</p><p>All configuration files share the same format. For
        example, a short extract of the main configuration file might
        look as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">
        # Space-separated list of directories to index.
        topdirs =  ~/docs /usr/share/doc

        [~/somedirectory-with-utf8-txt-files]
        defaultcharset = utf-8
        </pre><p>There are three kinds of lines: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Comment (starts with

          value</em></span>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Section definition
          ([<span class="emphasis"><em>somedirname</em></span>]).</p></li></ul></div><p>Depending on the type of configuration file, section
        definitions either separate groups of parameters or allow
        redefining some parameters for a directory sub-tree. They stay
        in effect until another section definition, or the end of
        file, is encountered. Some of the parameters used for indexing
        are looked up hierarchically from the current directory
        location upwards. Not all parameters can be meaningfully
        redefined, this is specified for each in the next
        section. </p><p>When found at the beginning of a file path, the tilde
        character (~) is expanded to the name of the user's home
        directory, as a shell would do.</p><p>White space is used for separation inside  lists.
        List elements with embedded spaces can be quoted using
        double-quotes.</p><p title="Encoding issues"><b>Encoding issues. </b>Most of the configuration parameters are plain ASCII. Two
        particular sets of values may cause encoding issues:</p><p>
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>File path parameters may contain non-ascii
        characters and should use the exact same byte values as found in

        encoding.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <code class="envar">unac_except_trans</code> parameter
        should be encoded in UTF-8. If your system locale is not UTF-8, and
        you need to also specify non-ascii file paths, this poses a
        difficulty because common text editors cannot handle multiple
        encodings in a single file. In this relatively unlikely case, you
        can edit the configuration file as two separate text files with
        appropriate encodings, and concatenate them to create the complete
        configuration.</p></li></ul></div><p>

        inside the main configuration file).</p><p>The mappings can be specified on a per-subtree basis,
        which may be useful in some cases. Example:
        <span class="application">gaim</span> logs have a

        file, with a few differences: it will not affect directories,
        it cannot be made dependant on the file-system location (it is
